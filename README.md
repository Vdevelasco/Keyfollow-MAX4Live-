Ever wanted to control a Live parameter with MIDI notes like you do with filters? Now you can. Added some presets and a curve function for more customization.

It should work with older versions.

Feedback is always appreciated!

Version 1.1 update:

Special thanks OCH for fixing the "preset not saving" problem. Thank you very much!
